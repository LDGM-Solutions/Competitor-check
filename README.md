# Competitor-check

This repository contains the **pub-price-intel** reference project used for experimenting with competitor price intelligence workflows. The `pub-price-intel/` directory mirrors the expected layout from the original brief, including scrapers, parsers, a matching CLI, and operational utilities.

Refer to [`pub-price-intel/README.md`](pub-price-intel/README.md) for implementation details and usage instructions.
